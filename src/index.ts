Programming patterns

3- Event-Driven
4- aspect oriented
5- object oriented


javaScript & typeScript => functional & object oriented

/* By putting objects together, our application is built. */

/* Each object is a unit that consists of two basic parts: 1- Data (state) 2- Behavior  (operation) */

/*
Object-oriented philosophy: We can simulate concepts and entities that exist in the real world.
*/

/*
person : 1- data ->( name, email)=> property
         2- behavior ->   (talk() , sleep() )

 
In the programming world, the behavior of a function is called a method.
And the data part in the variable is called a property.
*/

/* Each object in the program has a task, and all objects work together to achieve a specific goal. */


/*

In object-oriented programming, the building blocks are objects.

In functional programming, the units that make up those functions are
